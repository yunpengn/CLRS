# 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

This chapter introducts some basic concepts of algorithms and its usages.

- An algorithm is correct, if and only if, it terminates and provides correct output for all inputs.
- Algorithms are used in different industries, which are rather complicated. However, most of the basis have been touched in the book.
